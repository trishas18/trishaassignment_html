//first of all -- create a assessment1.html and use this script in that file
let pizza=true;

//1. assign  a value false to it and print it on console


const pizza1 = true

//2.try to assign and print it and write down the message that you get


//difference between var and let

var topic = "Javascript";

if (topic){

    let topic="React"
    //3.print here topic
}

//4.print here topic on the console 
//5.note down both the values

//6. create a  div with id container in html file  -- write done here in comment once done

//7.in this script get its reference of the element with id "container"


//8. using the traditional for loop which should iterate for 5 times
//  every iteration  should :
// 8a .create element div
//8b add event listener for click function and on clicked it should display  a message displaying  the iteration number
//8c. add div to the container


//9 create  a const email which has to use template strings
// to display some string literals along with variable values


/*
you have to replace everything in << >> with the variable
email = 
Hello <<firstName>>
Thanks for ordering <<qty>> tickets to <<event>>.

Order Details :
<<firstname>> <<middlename>> <<lastname>>
<<qty>> * <<price>> = <<qty*price>> to <<event>>


You can pick up your tickets up 30 minutes before the show

<<ticketAgent>>.
